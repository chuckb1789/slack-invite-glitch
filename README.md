# Auto-invite page for your Slack community - WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a simple Slack auto-invite page based on the one used on [botmakers.org](https://botmakers.org/).

First, update your '.env' file:

```
COMMUNITY_NAME='My community'
COMMUNITY_DESCRIPTION='Short description of your community.'
SLACK_URL='https://mycommunity.slack.com/'
SLACK_TOKEN='SECRETSTUFF123'
CONTACT='your@email.com'
```
You can get your Slack token [here](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens)


Enjoy!


TODO:

- Clean up the generated CSS file.
- Add a proper footer.
